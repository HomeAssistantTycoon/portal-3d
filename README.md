 # 3D On MakeCode Arcade

 This is the most bug-free 3D version of Portal on MakeCode Arcade! Well, it's not actual 3D, this project uses ray casting, a form of fake 3D. Games like DOOM used ray casting. Want to play this in MakeCode? Just go to extensions, and paste this in: https://github.com/HomeAssistantTycoon/portal-3d and have fun!
